# HangMan Game
This is the popular hangman game with Java in the terminal.<br>
In this game, we have some letters that you have to gonna guess in some cycles, and if you lose, the game will hang the man after all.<br>
Notice that you couldn't choose the repetitious word and if you did, you have to choose another letter.<br>
The letters are routine words for your ease, you can replace them with your words if you want.<br>
# Explane the game
You have to signup first, if you don't have an account else you log in easily.<br>
After that, you go to your account and you have options such as playing the game, seeing the leaderboard, or exiting <br>
The leaderboard read from the files that save and update after each game plays<br>
This is the schema of the game after the clone:

The player can press '#' just once in the game and one letter will show up for the player.<br>
